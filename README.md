## What is Python Math Game?
> It's a simple application that runs on prompt or terminal where you get points for each right answer on a equation challenge. I've built this game intending to learn manipulating lists, dicts, reading and storing data in a external file (.txt in this case). 

## Running the application
Simply run the following command: 

```
python main.py

```

Run it inside the downloaded folder to execute the main program. You only need python v3 or later to run the program.
